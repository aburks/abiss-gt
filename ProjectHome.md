A Bluetooth Intelligent Sound System (ABISS) is being designed in ECE 4007, Electrical & Computer Engineering Design Project, at the Georgia Institute of Technology under Dr. Linda Milor. ABISS integrates software and hardware components in order to stream audio wirelessly via Bluetooth in car or home audio systems. The audio will be streamed from a Bluetooth Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) capable device to an ABISS receiver that will output analog audio through a 1/8‚Äù stereo mini-jack. The analog audio signal will be played through a home or car audio system.

Additionally, the ABISS software will compare the signal strength of the nearby receivers, which makes the computer aware of the proximity of the ABISS receivers and stream audio to the one closest to the user. The Bluetooth 2.0+EDR standard will be used to transmit the audio signals wirelessly. Bluetooth was chosen because it is implemented in all current generation mobile devices. The ABISS software will work on all computers with Bluetooth and Mac OS X because it will be built on universally available APIs.

We are pursuing this product because it will enable consumers to maintain their mobility while listening to their music at home or in their car. Proximity awareness will provide the customer with the ability to experience audio that moves between rooms with them. Comparable products are not capable of pairing with multiple devices or detecting which of the devices is closest to the user.
